Enhancing Stock Price Prediction: Investigating the Impact of Lagged Observations in the ARIMA Model

Abstract

Stock Price Prediction is very important for investors as it helps them make buy, hold or
sell decisions. This study aims to investigate the impact of increasing the number of lagged
observations in the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model on the
prediction accuracy of average trading prices for value stocks.
ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a time series
forecasting model which uses historical data to come up with future prediction. This model
can be applied to a wide range of domains, including finance, economics, and weather
forecasting. This model has 3 different components and on this study, we are investigating
the impact of lagged observations.
This study looks at closing price of 10 value stocks each from 10 different sectors over
the period of 10 years (2009 to 2019).
At the end of the study, it was discovered that indeed when the number of lagged
observations is increased, the model performance improves. This is a significant finding as
it helps investors make calculated investing decisions on an everyday basis.
